# Ecommence-Node-Express-API
This is a **Nodejs RESTFULL API** that uses MongoDB for database, body-parser and multer for file upload, JSON web token for authentication, bcryptjs for password hashing, and express for server.

# Getting Started 
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# Prerequisites 
You will need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine.

# Installing
1. Clone the repository  
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/nodejs-restful-api.git` 

1. Install the dependencies  
```npm install```  

1. Start the server  
```npm start``` 

# Endpoints  
The API has the following endpoints:

POST /api/user/signup  
POST /api/user/login  
DELETE /api/user/userID  

GET /api/product  
POST /api/product  
GET /api/product/productId  
PATCH /api/product/productId  
DELETE /api/product/productId  

GET /api/order  
POST /api/order  
GET /api/order/orderId  
PATCH /api/order/orderId  
DELETE /api/order/orderId
